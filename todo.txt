# TODO

* PageTable add mut/ref versions of many functions upstream
        that way we can use &self instead of &mut self in many places
    * simplify our code to use &self where possible
* Page table pages should be NO_EXEC
* Figure out Emacs Org mode for todo list
* fix tests in staticvec
* check tests in other libraries
* log level for init logging needs a proper concept
